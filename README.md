1. Go to the [Latest Release](https://github.com/airdenmark/ffmpeg-Video-Downloader/releases/latest).
2. Download the `.zip` file (e.g., `ffmpeg.Video.Downloader.v1.1.1.zip`).
3. Extract the contents to a folder of your choice.
4. **Pro Tip:** Right-click the `.exe` file, select **Properties**, check the **Unblock** box at the bottom, and click **OK**. This prevents Windows from asking for permission every time you run the app.
5. Run the `.exe` file to start downloading!
